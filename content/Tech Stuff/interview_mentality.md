To describe interviews in one word, I would say "uncertainty".

People ask questions with different intents: to test your knowledge or to get some solutions. Even when you are certain which one it is, sometimes the questions are formulated poorly, leading to miscommunication. Sometimes it's a closed question disguised as an open one (more common than you think), and a guessing game begins.

But you cannot change people. What to do?

First you know there are certain people you'll meet at interviews:

- The HR: very straightforward. If they are not, the company has a big problem. HRs are supposed to be the ones with good EQ (if EQ is even a thing), and they shouldn't get you confused.
- The seniors: Your future colleges or immediate supervisors. You and them likely share the same language, yet they still can miscommunicate their intent. If you are in IT, the chance is even higher. You have better chance reading their intents in codes.
- The supervisor of your future supervisor: If you are approved by the seniors, you'll likely meet this person in the final round. She/he is usually 40-something, several health conditions, just got out of a meeting. Don't get surprised that this guy has the technical background of the HR and the EQ of the seniors. Don't underestimate him either. These Hippos are not the best symphathizer, but they care about their company more than most - gotta respect that.

Now that you are more informed about your audience, here're the strategy:
- with HR and seniors: they are relatively easy to navigate. They are also more forgiving and less opinionated, so it's safe to ask them to clarify their questions.
- with the Hippo: be respectful. Frame them as your client, and client requests a lot. In the interview, you are the solution architect, the expert, the ChadGPT, even if you are not or will never be. Be the man of vision, tell them what you think could have been done to better something. Feel free to be a little ambitious in your answer (even if you cannot do all the things you said, someone can, it's the ideas that matter). One thing you shouldn't do is name-drop technologies/jargons to him like you did to the seniors. Humans don't like things they don't understand, and the Hippo is human too.

>In my last job, my senior picked graph as the main solution. My CTO disliked it, he wanted tabular. The CTO is a 70s PhD, very out-of-touch, got sick all the time. Yet he still had the time to dislike something. Isn't that amazing? 

When asked about your last projects, avoid steering the conversation into why your projects suck (lack of resources, employees quit, etc.). It's an interview, and people want to see how you think. It's Okay that your last project is flawed, incomplete, undeployed (more common than you think), as long as you have detailed plans for patches and upgrades. This reinforces your frame as a man of ideas, not the victim of consequences.

Seriously don't how to gracefully end this post.
