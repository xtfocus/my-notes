To describe an interview with one word, I would say "uncertainty".

People ask you questions with different intents: to test your knowledge or to get some solutions. Even when you are certain which one it is, sometimes the questions are formulated poorly, leading to miscommunication. Sometimes it's a closed question disguised as an open one (more common than you think), and a guessing game begins.

But you cannot change people. What to do?

First you know there are certain people you'll meet during interviews:

- the HR: very straightforward. If they are not, the company has a big problem. HRs are supposed to be the ones with good EQ (if EQ is even a thing), and they shouldn't get you confused.
- The seniors: Your future colleges or immediate supervisors. You and them likely share the same language, yet they still sometimes miscommunicate their intent. This happens not just to you but sometimes to their wife.
- The supervisor of your future supervisor: If you are approved by the seniors, you're likely to meet this person next. She/He's usually well over 30s, several health conditions, just got out of a meeting. Don't get surprised that this guy has the technical background of the HR and the EQ of the seniors. Don't underestimate him either.

Now that you have been more informed about your audience, what's the strategy:
- with HR and seniors: they are relatively easy to navigate. They are also more forgiving and less opinionated, so it's safe to ask them to clarify their questions.
- with the Hippo: be respectful. Frame them as your client, and client requests a lot. In the interview, you are the solution architect, even if you are not or will never be. Be the man of vision, tell them what you think could have been done to better something. Be ambitious in your answer (even if you cannot do all the things you said, someone can, it's the ideas that matter). Most importantly, don't name drop technologies/jargons to your client like you did to the seniors. Humans don't like things they don't understand, and the Hippo is human too.

When asked about your last projects, avoid steering the conversation into why your projects suck (lack of resources, employees quit, etc.). It's an interview, and people want to see how you think. It's Okay that your last project is flawed, incomplete, undeployed (more common than you think), as long as you have detailed plans for patches and upgrades. This reinforces your frame as a man of ideas, not the victim of consequences.

Seriously don't how to gracefully end this post.
