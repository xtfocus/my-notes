The [MLOps course](https://www.facebook.com/fullstackdatascience) is in Vietnamese. I worked with a very special and talented guy who co-hosted this course, so when I asked if I can join it, he gave me a very special offer that I cannot say no.

Getting gooder at MLOps is among my goals for the year, because I want to build systems, not just a model. I think LLMs won't catch up with MLOps soon, as commits are coming out every day, ifkyk. I believe I'm in good hands at [fullstackdatascience](https://www.facebook.com/fullstackdatascience).
